# Tintolmarket


Tintolmarket is a CLI Client-Server Distributed Application that represents a Wine Store, similar to _Vivino_, but with
some new features (Clients are able to buy and sell wine).

# How to Compile

- Open a CLI (README directory), run the following command: `javac -d obj src/domain/*.java src/interfaces/*.java`.

# How to run

- Open 1 CLI (README directory or where the TintolmarketServer.jar is located) for running the Server and 1 or more CLI's (README directory or where the Tintolmarket.jar is located) for running 1 or multiple clients at the same time.


- In the Server CLI execute the following command: `java -jar TintolmarketServer.jar {serverPort (optional)} 123456 keystore.server 123456`


- In the Client CLI execute the following command: `java -jar Tintolmarket.jar {serverIP:{serverPort (optional)}}} truststore.clients keystore.{userID} 123456 {userID}`


- **PS:** If you give the server a `serverPort` you need to give the same `serverPort` to the clients.
