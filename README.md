# Tintolmarket


Tintolmarket is a CLI Client-Server Distributed Application that represents a Wine Store, similar to _Vivino_, but with
some new features (Clients are able to buy and sell wine).

- - -

# How to run

- Open 1 CLI for running the Server and 1 or more CLI's for running 1 or multiple clients at the same
time.


- `cd "path where the .jar [ Tintolmarket.jar (Client) / TintolmarketServer.jar (Server) ] is located"`


- In the Server CLI execute the following command: `java -jar TintolmarketServer.jar {serverPort (optional)}`


- In the Client CLI execute the following command: `java -jar Tintolmarket.jar {serverIP:{serverPort (optional)}}} {username} {password (optional)}`


- **PS:** If you give the server a `serverPort` you need to give the same `serverPort` to the clients.
